## Resident Evil: Revelations Gameplay Tips
 
Resident Evil: Revelations is not an easy game, especially on higher difficulties. You will face many enemies and challenges that will test your skills and resources. Here are some tips to help you survive and enjoy the game:

- Don't neglect your melee weapon: In the event that you run out of ammo during a fight, your knife can be a real lifesaver. What's more, there are times when you can perform a powerful melee attack on a stunned enemy, which can save you bullets and deal massive damage.
- Scan everything with the Genesis: The Genesis is a bio-hazard scanner that puts you in first person mode to scan enemies and locations for hidden items. Scanning enough enemies will reward you with a health item. Scanning hidden handprints will unlock new weapons and custom parts in Raid mode.
- Manage your inventory wisely: You have limited space in your inventory, so you need to decide what to carry and what to leave behind. You can store extra items in item boxes that are scattered throughout the game. You can also swap items with your partner if they have something you need.
- Upgrade your weapons and custom parts: You can find various weapons and custom parts in the game that can enhance your firepower, accuracy, reload speed, capacity, and more. You can equip up to three custom parts on each weapon, and you can swap them at any time in the menu. Experiment with different combinations to suit your playstyle.
- Use herbs and grenades effectively: Herbs are essential for healing yourself and your partner. You can use them directly from the menu or assign them to a shortcut button for quick access. Grenades are useful for dealing with groups of enemies or breaking weak walls. You can find different types of grenades, such as flash, shock, and decoy.
- Explore every corner: Resident Evil: Revelations has many secrets and hidden items that can help you in your journey. You can find ammo, herbs, weapons, custom parts, documents, handprints, and more by exploring every corner of the game. Some items are only accessible by solving puzzles or using specific weapons.

With these tips in mind, you should be ready to face the horrors of Resident Evil: Revelations. Good luck!
